Losing our best O-Lineman is fucking shitty. Glad to hear Zak Zinter is doing well now though. Scary as hell to see that live. \n\nLosing Will Johnson also sucks but Michigan does luck out a bit that they could honestly consider resting Will Johnson against Iowa. Or at least have him dressed in a \"break glass in case of emergency\" situation.\n\n___\n\nBUT I'M GONNA FUCKING COMPLAIN ABOUT COMMERCIALS!\n\nFull TV timeouts should not interrupt drives. It interrupts offensive flow and gives the defense more of a break than they would normally get otherwise (especially when the breaks are 3:50 each)."}
